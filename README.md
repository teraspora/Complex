# A Complex number class in Java.

This class implements all the standard fundamental component-manipulating, arithmetic, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, comparison, averaging and vector functions of complex numbers as static or instance methods.

It also provides a number of constants, such as `Complex.ZERO`, `Complex.ONE`, `Complex.I` and a few more.

All the main arithmetic operators are implemented in both static and instance forms, so, for example, 
`Complex.product(z, w)` can, alternatively, be written as `z.times(w)`.

Many of the methods are not commented as their functionality is clear and the implementation thereof obvious.

Other methods are commented to clarify their functionality.

I have forborne to attach javadoc comments like `@param`, `@return` etc. to each method as this would make the code much harder to read.   The easiest way to discover what's goin' on is to read the code!

## Prerequisites

Compiles with Java 10.   Should also work with Java 7+.
